            <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca),<br>
            sometimes called a panda bear or simply panda,<br>
            is a bear species endemic to China.It is characterised<br>
            by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body.<br>
            The name "giant panda" is sometimes <br>
            used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.<br>
            Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore,<br>
            with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.<br>
            Giant pandas in the wild occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers,<br>
            or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity,<br>
            they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges,<br>
            or bananas along with specially prepared food.</p>
