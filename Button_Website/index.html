    <h1 class="title">Fun Facts About Sloths</h1>
    <p>David Attenborough once said if he could be any animal,
        he would be a sloth â€” because he would have a good life,
        with "nothing much to do."
        <br>
        Perhaps he was referring to the fact that sloths are 
        the slowest-moving mammals in the world. In fact, 
        it will take you less time to read this text than 
        it takes a sloth to move a few meters!
        <br>
        Slow movers â€¦ and eaters!
        Sloths travel fewer than 40 meters a day, on average.
        They move slowly because they mostly eat leaves,
        which don't give them enough energy to move quickly.
        <br>
        They also have the slowest metabolism of any mammal.
        It could take them as long as 30 days to digest one leaf!
        <br>
        But this doesn't affect their strength. Sloths are about three
        times stronger than the average human, according to the Sloth Conservation Foundation.
        <br>
        Tree hangers
        Sloths spend up to 90% of their lives hanging upside down in trees â€” mostly sleeping.
        A sloth sleeps between 15 and 20 hours each day.
        <br>
        Sometimes they fall, and that's okay! They can fall up to 30 meters without getting hurt,
        and on average they fall out of trees about once a week.
        <br>And if they fall in water,
        that's okay, too. Sloths are good swimmers, and they move faster in water than they do in trees!
        <br>
        Their fur is a home for others
        Many different insects and algae live in a sloth's fur â€” it's good for them because
        it's warm and sometimes wet, and sloths don't move much.
        <br>
        Algae also gives the sloth's fur a green color, helping it blend in with the trees,
        and keeping it safe from other animals.</p>
