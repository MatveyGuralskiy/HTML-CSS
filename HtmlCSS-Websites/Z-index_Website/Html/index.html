            Switzerland, officially the <span>Swiss Confederation,</span><br>
            is a landlocked country located in west-central Europe. <br>
            It is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, <br>
            Germany to the north and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. <br>
            Switzerland is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau, <br>
            the Alps and the Jura; the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, <br>
            whereas most of the country's population of 9 million are concentrated on the plateau, <br>
            which hosts the largest cities and economic centres, including Zürich, Geneva and Basel. <br>

                This lakefront city on the Swiss-Italian border offers visitors a unique travel experience. <br>
                Because Lugano shares waters with neighboring Italy, the city features a mix of Swiss <br>
                and Mediterranean influences in everything from its cuisine to its architecture. <br>
                Plus, Lugano boasts unforgettable panoramas. Visit Monte San Salvatore and Monte Brè, <br>
                both of which you can reach by funicular, for bird's-eye views of Lake Lugano and the city. <br>
                Or, spend a few hours hiking the Olive Grove Trail or strolling the gardens of Ciani Park. <br>
                If you'd rather lounge on a beach, head to Lido di Lugano. <br>
